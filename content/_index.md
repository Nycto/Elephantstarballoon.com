## Necsus

https://github.com/NecsusECS/Necsus

Necsus is an entity component system (ECS) library for the Nim programming
language that leverages Nim's macro capabilities to minimize boilerplate code in
ECS-based applications. In Necsus, components are standard Nim types, systems
are regular procedures, and entity management is abstracted away, simplifying
the development process. This design approach aims to keep the cognitive load
low while providing the benefits of an ECS architecture.

To define an application using Necsus, developers apply the necsus pragma to a
function declaration, integrating various systems into the application's
lifecycle. Systems can be designated to execute during startup, each loop
iteration, or teardown phases, offering flexibility in application behavior.
This structured methodology facilitates the creation of complex, efficient
applications with clear separation of concerns.
