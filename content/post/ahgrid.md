I've been exploring spatial indexing lately, trying to balance performance and
simplicity in scenarios where objects of varying sizes need to be indexed and
queried quickly. While looking at some of the available algorithms, I had an
idea of my own. I've been searching for prior art to determine if this is a "new" idea, but
haven't found any yet. I'm sharing this approach to encourage feedback.

For the purpose of this article, I'm calling this an **Adaptive Hash Grid**
(AHGrid). It's a twist on a few other existing algorithms. But I think it's an
interesting approach because of how simple the implementation winds up being.

## The Problem with Traditional Grids

If you've ever used a basic grid to index objects in a 2D space, you've probably
hit a familiar problem: What happens when an object spans multiple cells?

Imagine a grid where each cell is exactly `10 units` wide and `10 units` tall.
If you insert an object that is 15x15 into that grid, it will overlap multiple
cells, forcing you to register the object with each cell it overlaps. When
querying for nearby objects, you have to check all four cells and deduplicate any
results if they straddle multiple cells. Querying for neighbors can quickly
balloon to searching through dozens of cells.

Quadtrees and Hierarchical Spatial Hash Grids have the same problem as a classical
fixed size grid -- they all require storing an object in all the cells that it overlaps.
This is because the edges between cells are fixed.

I also wanted a system that could represent objects of wildly varying size spread
out across a basically unbound space (`low(int32)..high(int32)`).

## Adaptive Hashing Grid

AHGrid is very similar to a spatial hash grid in that it stores objects in a multimap
using a calculated index to colocate objects that are nearby:

```nim
Table[CellIndex, seq[T]]
```

The difference with `AHGrid` is the way the `CellIndex` is calculated. For a 2D grid,
`AHGrid` incorporates the `x` and `y` coordinates, but also adds a concept of a `scale`:

```nim
type CellIndex = tuple[x, y, scale: int32]
```

The `scale` property encodes the size of the object rounded up to the next power of two.
You can think of it being calculated in the following way:

```nim
proc calculateScale(width, height: int32): int32 =
  max(width, height).int.nextPowerOfTwo.int32
```

This means that an `AHGrid` secretly has multiple layers that are transparently
overlaid within the same `Table`. Each new value for `scale` constitutes a new
layer. For each layer, the size of the cells it contains is 2x as
big as the previous layer. This is very similar to how a Hierarchical Spatial
Hash Grid works in concept, but flattened into a single storage container.

The next twist that an `AHGrid` adds is that every layer offsets its root
coordinate by half its size. This leads to a very important property: adjacent
layers don't share the same edges between cells. Put another way, the boundaries
between each layer are always at an offset from the layer beneath it. In one
dimensional space, that looks like this:

![ahgrid layers](/ahgrid/scales.svg)

This offset is what allows us to put an object into exactly one cell -- if an
object overlaps an edge in one layer, we just need to bump up to the next layer.
Being in one cell allows queries to be more efficient, as we don't have to worry
about deduplicating the results. We know that we can blindly yield all the values
within the cell without tracking what has already been returned.

Let's walk through the insertion process to see how this works.

## Insert operation

To insert an object into the grid, we start by finding the smallest layer that
can fully contain that object:

![ahgrid layers](/ahgrid/insert-simple.svg)

Above, the object is `3 units` wide at an offset of `3`. We can immediately choose an
initial `scale` by bumping the size up to the next power of 2, which puts us at a scale
of `4`. And because the object fits entirely within the cell from `2` to `5`, we're done.

However, if we do the above operation the object overlaps the edge of its cell, we move
up to the next layer until we find one where the object doesn't overlap the boundaries.
You can see the same object as below, but this time it has an offset of `4`. That puts the
right edge over the boundary of the cell of scale 4:

![ahgrid layers](/ahgrid/insert-bumped.svg)

In this case, we can bump the scale up to `8` and the object now fits entirely within
a single cell at the next layer up.

### In code

To see how this works, lets look at the implementation. Imagine we want to insert a 2D object
with `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` parameters:

```nim
type
  SpatialObject* = concept obj
    obj.x is int32
    obj.y is int32
    obj.width is int32
    obj.height is int32
```

**First**, we choose the smallest layer that best fits this object. Because the cell size for
each layer is a power of 2, we just need to find the next power of two based on the maximum
width or height. This is the same code you saw above:

```nim
var scale = max(obj.width, obj.height).int.nextPowerOfTwo.int32
```

**Second**, we independently examine the `x` and `y` coordinates and choose the cell index
that the object would fall into. This looks the same for both `x` and `y`, so we can create
a function that operates on a single coordinate at a time. In a Hierarchical Spatial Hash Grid,
this would just be `coord div scale`. But because we need to offset the root
coordinate for each layer by half the scale, we need to get a bit fancier:

```nim
proc cellIndex(coord, scale: int32): int32 =
  let half = scale div 2
  # We need to specifically adjust the index to handle negative coordinates. This
  # looks funky because we also have to deal with the shifting root coordinates
  let adjust = if coord + half >= 0: 0'i32 else: -scale + 1
  return (coord + half + adjust) div scale * scale - half
```

**Third**, we make sure the object we're processing fits entirely within the
cell we've picked. If it doesn't, then we need to increase the `scale` of the
cell until the object fits entirely within it.

```nim
proc pickCellIndex(grid: AHGrid, x, y, width, height: int32): CellIndex =
  var scale = max(width, height).int.nextPowerOfTwo.int32
  while true:
    let output = (x: x.cellIndex(scale), y: y.cellIndex(scale), scale: scale)

    # Ensure the object fits entirely within the cell
    if x + width < output.x + scale and y + height < output.y + scale:
        return output

    # If it doesn't, try fitting the object into the next layer up
    scale = scale * 2
```

Put that all together and we have now picked a single cell that we know will fit
the entire object.

## Storage and Inserting

As the name of the algorithm would imply, the values being indexed are stored in a table.
All the values with the same `CellIndex` are stored together, as they, by definition,
are near each other. It looks like this:

```nim
type
  AHGrid*[T: SpatialObject] = object
    maxScale: int32
    cells: Table[CellIndex, seq[T]]
```

Notice that we also need to store the `maxScale`. That's in there so that queries know
how many layers they need to query before stopping.

With the type definition above, inserting an object can be done in linear time:

```nim
proc insert*[T](grid: var AHGrid[T], obj: T) =
  let key = obj.pickCellIndex(grid)
  grid.maxScale = max(grid.maxScale, key.scale)
  grid.cells.mgetOrPut(key, newSeq[T]()).add(obj)
```

## Querying at a point

To now find all the objects that are near a given point, we can implement a query by
calculating the `CellIndex` for each `scale` within the grid. Visually, if you wanted
to query for anything that exists at the 1d coordinate `8`, it would look like this:

![query at point](/ahgrid/query-point.svg)

In code, that looks like:

```nim
iterator eachScale(grid: AHGrid): int32 =
  var scale = 0
  while scale <= grid.maxScale:
    yield scale
    scale *= 2

iterator find*[T](grid: AHGrid[T]; x, y: int32): T =
  for scale in grid.eachScale:
    let key = pickCellIndex(x, y, scale)
    for obj in grid.cells.getOrDefault(keys):
      yield obj
```

This dynamic scaling adapts smoothly to the size and spread of the data, minimizing unnecessary checks.

## Querying with a radius

Within game development, it's common to need to know everything that is within
a radius of a specific point. For example, finding all the enemies that might
be impacted by an explosion.

To handle this use case, we can add a radius to our `find` iterator.  This requires
doing a search for every `CellIndex` that is within the radius of the search point:

![query at point](/ahgrid/query-range.svg)

In code, that looks like:

```nim
iterator eachCellIndex(x, y, radius, scale: int32): CellIndex =
  let xRange = cellIndex(x - radius, scale)..cellIndex(x + radius, scale)
  let yRange = cellIndex(y - radius, scale)..cellIndex(y + radius, scale)

  for x in countup(xRange.a, xRange.b, scale):
    for y in countup(yRange.a, yRange.b, scale):
      yield (x, y, scale)

iterator find*[T](grid: AHGrid[T]; x, y, radius: int32): T =
  for scale in grid.eachScale:
    for key in eachCellIndex(x, y, radius, scale):
      for obj in grid.cells.getOrDefault(key):
        yield obj
```

## Optimizing usage

To make the most of the AHGrid approach, there are a few optimization strategies to consider:

* Initial Sizing for Hash Tables and Lists

  When initializing your hash tables and nested lists, itâ€™s helpful to estimate
  the number of cells and objects you expect to store. By pre-allocating space
  in your hash table and object lists, you can avoid costly reallocations as the
  data grows. If you expect a large, sparse distribution of data, you may want
  to use a more aggressive initial capacity for the hash table.

* Adding a Minimum Scale (`minScale`)

  Another critical parameter that can be added to this implementation is the
  notion of a "minimum scale", or `minScale`. This value sets the smallest cell
  size used by the grid, acting as a lower bound for the `scale` factor. If the
  `minScale` is too small, queries will need to search through many cells,
  increasing the cost of each lookup. If itâ€™s too large, you lose the
  granularity and benefits of a spatial index.

* Skip the hash table entirely

  Technically, we don't even need a `Table`. We could use an array of arrays
  and do the index management ourselves. This would let us guarantee that we never
  have to deal with table resizing.

* Use a `HashSet` instead of a `seq`

  In the example code, I'm using a `Table` that contains a `seq`. One possible
  optimization would be using a set instead. Thought I didn't discuss removal
  in this article, using a set would potentially make that operation faster.

## Alternate Approaches and Comparisons

While the Adaptive Hash Grid has proven effective for my needs, it's helpful to
understand how it compares to other spatial hashing techniques. Here are a few
common approaches:

* Fixed-Size Grids: These are simple to implement but suffer from overlapping
  issues when objects span multiple cells. They also struggle with varying
  object sizes or non-uniformly distributed data.
* Quadtrees: Quadtrees dynamically divide space, making them suitable for varied
  object sizes. However, they can become unbalanced with irregular data
  distributions and often require complicated balancing or depth-limited
  optimizations.
* Hierarchical Spatial Hash Grids: These are more flexible than fixed grids,
  leveraging multiple levels of granularity. However, objects still overlap
  cells across levels, necessitating deduplication during querying.

Adaptive Hash Grid strikes a balance between these approaches. By adjusting
cell sizes dynamically while maintaining a flat hash table, AHGrid reduces
overlaps, minimizes query time, and simplifies implementation.

## Strengths

- **Simplicity:** Uses a flat hash table â€” no deep tree traversals, no rebalancing. This
  algorithm is _really_ easy to implement
- **Adaptability:** Supports objects of any size within a single cell.
- **Efficient Queries:** No deduplication needed due to unique cell assignment.
- **Infinite Space:** Because we're using a hash table to store the data, we can store
  two objects that are at opposite ends of a grid as efficiently as storing two that
  are close together

## Weaknesses

* **Cache Locality:** Because we're using a hash table, memory locality could
  suffer. This is especially noticeable if the grid is large and queries need to
  traverse multiple levels of scaling. Compared to a linear or tree-based
  structure, the cache efficiency might be lower.

* **Large Query Radii:** A large query radius is going to cause a lot of cells
  to be visited, reducing efficiency. This could be a bigger issue if large queries are frequent

* **Integer only:** This implementation relies on a lot of integer based math and
  doesn't really work for floats. Any usage would first need to convert a float into
  an int. This is trivial with a fixed point system, though.

* **Scaling Factor Sensitivity:** Choosing the right `minScale` is crucial. If the scaling
  is off, it can lead to either too many grid levels (increasing overhead) or too few (leading
  to dense cells that degrade query performance).

## Conclusion

There are certainly some improvements and extensions that can be made to this implementation.
For example, being able to remove objects or update them in place. Supporting 3D objects, too.
Those are all fairly trivial changes, though.

I've been using this for Game development, where I need to quickly and dynamically
index a large number of game entities -- it has worked well so far!
